//! The workspace — sprag's pane registry (the multiplexer's producer pool).
//!
//! README core scope ("멀티플렉싱: ... pane 생명주기"): the multiplexer
//! manages a set of live [`TerminalSession`] panes. This is a producer-layer
//! concern — owning PTYs and their lifecycle — so it stays pinion-free here;
//! the pinion scene/control surface lives one layer up in sprag-host (the
//! `WorkspaceExternal`).
//!
//! Headless multiplexing is pane *control*, not visual tiling: each pane is
//! an independently-sized terminal addressed by [`PaneId`]. This pool holds no
//! arrangement at all — it is the membership authority (which panes exist), and
//! nothing more.
//!
//! ## Round 7's "no split tree here" note, superseded in part
//!
//! That note said a split tree "only has meaning relative to a display surface
//! to divide, so it is a rendering concern". True of PIXEL geometry (what rect a
//! pane occupies at one client's size) — that stays in the display client. But it
//! conflated pixels with the LOGICAL arrangement (which panes are split, in what
//! order, at what proportion), which is session state: tmux keeps it server-side
//! so a client can detach and reattach — at a different size, from a different
//! machine — and get its layout back. The detach/reattach arc therefore moved the
//! logical arrangement host-side into [`Window`](crate::Window)'s
//! [`LayoutTree`](crate::LayoutTree) (still pinion-free, still rect-free); pixels
//! remain the client's. It is deliberately NOT in this pool: membership and
//! arrangement are separate authorities, and the arrangement reconciles against
//! this one.
