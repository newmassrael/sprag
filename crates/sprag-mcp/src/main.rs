//! `sprag-mcp` — the **agent-facing surface** over the sprag terminal host.
//!
//! sprag's north star is "an AI reads and drives the terminal as *data*": the
//! headless host (`sprag-term`) owns every pane's PTY and serves a JSON-RPC wire
//! (pane list, cell/full-text read, key/text input) over an always-on Unix socket.
//! That capability was already complete — but an agent *dropped into a pane* had no
//! way to DISCOVER it: it saw only an opaque `SPRAG_HOST_RPC_SOCK` env var and would
//! have to reverse-engineer the wire from source. This binary closes that gap.
//!
//! It is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) **stdio
//! server**: Claude Code (or any MCP client) spawns it and it speaks newline-delimited
//! JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout. It advertises eleven self-describing tools —
//! `list_panes`, `read_pane`, `read_last_command`, `read_pane_links`, `read_pane_images`,
//! `find_in_pane`, `regex_in_pane`, `agent_state`, `agent_explain`, `write_pane`, `send_keys` — so an
//! agent *immediately* understands "read/write a sibling pane" without reading any sprag
//! source. The two `agent_*` tools are the surface for the one fact an agent cannot read off a
//! sibling's screen without interpreting it: whether the AI in that pane is waiting for a human
//! (H3). They report the daemon's own verdict, so two agents watching one pane agree.
//!
//! Each tool call bridges to the host wire via [`sprag_rpc::HostConn`], addressing panes with the
//! [`sprag_host::wire`] path SSOT.
//!
//! ## Locating the host (works in any pane, no per-instance config)
//!
//! The host socket path is per-GUI-instance (`sprag-gui-host-<pid>.sock`), so it
//! cannot be hard-coded in a global MCP registration. [`host_sock`] resolves it in
//! two layers, so the server self-configures regardless of whether the MCP client
//! forwards the env var:
//!
//! 1. This process's own `SPRAG_HOST_RPC_SOCK` (set if the client inherits/forwards
//!    the pane shell's environment).
//! 2. Failing that, walk the `/proc` parent-process chain from our own PID and read
//!    the first ancestor that carries `SPRAG_HOST_RPC_SOCK` in its environment — the
//!    `sprag-term` host is always an ancestor of a pane's processes, so its socket is
//!    discoverable from inside its own process tree with no configuration at all.
//!
//! When neither resolves (the agent is NOT inside a sprag pane), every tool returns a
//! clear "not inside a sprag terminal" error instead of failing opaquely.
//!
//! ## Protocol
//!
//! Only the minimal server surface is implemented: `initialize` (echoing the client's
//! `protocolVersion` for forward-compat), `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `ping`;
//! notifications (`notifications/initialized`, `notifications/cancelled`) are accepted
//! and dropped. stdout carries ONLY protocol JSON — all diagnostics go to stderr via
//! `tracing` (env `SPRAG_LOG`, default `warn`).

// A binary crate: `cargo doc` builds it with private items, and the crate-root doc above links
// to the bin's own internals (e.g. [`host_sock`]) as a navigable map. `private_intra_doc_links`
// guards LIBRARY public-API docs, which publish without private items; a bin has no such
// surface, so the lint is a structural false positive here (mirrors `sprag-gui`).
