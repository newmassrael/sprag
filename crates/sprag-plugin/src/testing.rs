//! Test-only ([`cfg(test)`]), and it exists because one of these cost two rebuilds of the same
//! gate before it measured anything. A plugin gate about *readiness* has to build a pane that is
//! genuinely NOT ready, and "not ready" is a stronger condition than it looks: see
//! [`STANDIN_READS_TTY`].

/// Redirection that gives a BACKGROUNDED reader the pane's own input.
///
/// # ⚠⚠ Why a stand-in without this measures nothing
///
/// A gate for a readiness barrier needs a pane that is not ready yet, and the only stand-in that
/// discriminates is one that EATS what it is given — because an un-eaten injection does not
/// vanish. It sits in the pseudoterminal's buffer, and the program that starts next reads it. So a
/// run that injected far too early still converges, off bytes it sent to nobody, and the gate
/// reports that the barrier worked.
///
/// The obvious spelling of a stand-in that steps aside on a timer is a background reader:
///
/// ```sh
/// while read early; do echo "ATE $early"; done &   # ⚠ reads /dev/null, eats NOTHING
/// sleep 2; kill $!; exec the-real-peer
/// ```
///
/// **A background job of a NON-INTERACTIVE shell gets its stdin from `/dev/null`** (POSIX: job
/// control is off, so the shell redirects it). The stand-in therefore reads end-of-file
/// immediately, consumes nothing, and the fixture is back to the un-eaten-bytes case with nothing
/// in its text to show it. Appending this reopens the controlling terminal — the pane's own input —
/// for that job, which is what makes the stand-in a stand-in.
///
/// ⚠ Belongs on the READER, before the `&`: `while read x; do …; done </dev/tty &`.
