//! **WHAT THIS CRATE HAS PROVEN ABOUT THE ENGINE IT RUNS ON** — the probes, and only the probes.
//!
//! # ⚠⚠⚠ Why a construct gets a probe before anything is built on it
//!
//! A generator's filters and a conformance suite's fixtures are facts about SOMEWHERE ELSE. The
//! `ai_loop` document carries the same warning about `===`, `JSON.stringify` and template
//! literals — every one of them promised by the engine's NAME and never shown to work at the
//! pinned rev. `probe_parent.scxml` asked that question of `<invoke>` and got a yes; this module
//! is where the answers live for the ones that need a RUN rather than a compile.
//!
//! ⚠ The `<invoke>` probe's own gate still lives beside the loop it was built for. This module
//! exists so the next probe does not have to.

    /// The template is meant to serve OTHER repositories and to hold several loop KINDS — a debt
    /// loop, a feature loop — possibly running at once. Measured, what separates those kinds is
    /// entirely `<data>`: consents, standing instructions, prompt wording, the marker, where the
    /// work list lives. **The topology is identical.** So the shape that does not duplicate a
    /// 2,000-line machine per kind is: one topology as a CHILD, and one document per kind as a
    /// PARENT that owns the decisions and fills the child in.
    ///
    /// That shape is only available if `<param>` on an `<invoke>` actually reaches a `<data>` the
    /// child declared. **If it does not, copying is back on the table** — and this workspace has
    /// already recorded what two copies of one rule cost once they drift.
    ///
    /// ⚠⚠ **THE PROOF TRAVELS OUT AND BACK.** A child cannot report its own datamodel to anybody
    /// but its parent, so the child echoes what it was told through `<donedata>` and the parent
    /// compares. The child's default is a sentence nobody would send — so the failure where the
    /// param never crossed reads differently from the failure where the child never ran.
