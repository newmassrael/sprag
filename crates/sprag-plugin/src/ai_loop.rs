//! The OUTER loop — the machine that drives an inner agent session, and what
//! measuring it said about the datamodel it was authored with.
//!
//! [`ai_loop.scxml`] is the third control statechart in this crate, after the
//! Driver's `orchestration.scxml` and the endpoint's `session.scxml`. Until this
//! round it was the only one that was **not compiled**: `build.rs`'s `STATECHARTS`
//! listed two of the three, so 312 lines of authored control flow were enforced by
//! nothing and eight Rust doc comments cited the document as an authority no
//! compiler had ever read.
//!
//! Adding it to that list is one word. What the word bought is this module.
